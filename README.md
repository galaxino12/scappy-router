# scappy-router
A simple script to read and copy an article to a text file.

Usage:

./scrappy-router.py url out.txt

For now it only works with a single link.

So, we use:

./scrappy-router.py https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-global-deaths/global-coronavirus-deaths-pass-agonizing-milestone-of-1-million-idUSKBN26K08Y out.txt

Or: 

./scrappy-router.py in.txt out.txt
